## `wp`: wikipedia on your terminal

Current features:

1. Display wikipedia articles on stdout as plaintext
2. Save wikipedia articles to disk as plaintext

### How to use

```
wp --link <LINK_TO_THE_ARTICLE> [--save]
```

The `--save` flag saves the article to disk rather than outputting to stdout.
